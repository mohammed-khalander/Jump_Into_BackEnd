/**
 *                      What is Middleware in Node.js?
 * 
*   --> Middleware is a function that executes during the lifecycle of a request to the server.
*   --> It has access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware in the application's   
*       request-response cycle.
*             -->  Middleware functions are primarily used for:
*
*                    * Executing code.
*                    * Modifying the request and response objects.
*                    * Ending the request-response cycle.
*                    * Calling the next middleware in the stack. 
                    
              
*              --> Middleware in the Request-Response Cycle
*                       --> Imagine this as a pipeline:
*                              (Client) Request → Middleware 1 → Middleware 2 → Middleware 3 → Response (Server) (Sent Back To Client)
*                               
*                       --> Each middleware decides whether to:
*                           Process the request further.
*                           Stop and respond.
*                           Modify the request/response along the way.

*                                        Informational responses (100 – 199)
*                                        Successful responses (200 – 299)
*                                        Redirection messages (300 – 399)
